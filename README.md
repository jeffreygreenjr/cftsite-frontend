# CHICAGO FIGHT TEAM

In my final unit of my Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp, I developed and deployed a full-stack MERN application. The purpose of this web application is to serve as a library of information to all things related to a mixed martial arts gym based in the Chicagoland area. As always, responsive design was taken into consideration, so enjoy this application accross all devices.

### Technologies Used
MonogoDB, Monogoose, Express, React, Node.js

#### Getting Started
To browse this application, please click on the follow link: https://chicagofightteam.herokuapp.com/. You will be loaded into the landing page. From there, you have many options to choose from via the nav bar. You can learn about the gym in the about page. You can view the coaches, classes, and fighters at the gym as well as the products available for purchase via the shop page.

#### Next Steps/Future Enhancements
Because I will be delivering this to a client, there are many updates/changes that will be needed as the gym's personnel changes. While I have the client-side functionality built, I still plan to implement updates the library of information displayed for viewers. In the future, I'd also like to implement some styling updates to make the application more user friendly and interractive.
